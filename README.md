# Approach

The Tomasulo simulator is designed with a centralized `SystemState` type, which represents the entire architecture's state at any given clock cycle. The `SystemState` object includes the following components:

## **SystemState Structure**
- **`instructionQueue`**: The queue of instructions to be executed.
- **`fpAddReservationStations`**: Floating-point reservation stations for addition and subtraction.
- **`fpMulReservationStations`**: Floating-point reservation stations for multiplication and division.
- **`intAddReservationStations`**: Integer reservation stations for addition and subtraction.
- **`loadBuffer`**: Array of load buffers.
- **`storeBuffer`**: Array of store buffers.
- **`fpRegisterFile`**: Floating-point register file.
- **`intRegisterFile`**: Integer register file.
- **`CDB`**: Centralized data bus for broadcasting results.
- **`memory`**: Represents the system memory.
- **`cache`**: Configurable cache structure.
- **`instructionTable`**: Table tracking issued, executed, and written-back instructions.
- **`clockCycle`**: Current clock cycle of the simulation.
- **`pc`**: Program counter, pointing to the next instruction to be issued.
- **`latencies`**: Instruction latency values.
- **`notes`**: Array for recording notable events during simulation.

---

## **Clock Cycle Updates**

Each clock cycle updates the `SystemState` dynamically through a central function:

### **`nextSystemState`**
- **Purpose**: Updates the system state for the current clock cycle.
- **Input**: Takes the current `SystemState` as input.
- **Process**:
  1. **Issue Instructions Function**:
    
  2. **Execute Instructions Function**:
    
  3. **Write Back Results Function**:
     

- **Output**: Returns the updated `SystemState` after completing the three phases (`issueInstruction`, `execute`, `writeBack`).


---

## **Issue Function**

1. **Fetch Instruction**:
   - The instruction is fetched from the `instructionQueue` using the `pc` value.

2. **Component Identification**:
   - The opcode of the instruction is analyzed to determine which reservation station or buffer is required:
     - **Floating-Point Reservation Stations**: For floating-point operations like `ADD.D`, `SUB.D`, `MUL.D`, and `DIV.D`.
     - **Integer Reservation Stations**: For integer operations like `DADDI`, `DSUBI`, and branch instructions (`BEQ`, `BNE`).
     - **Load Buffer**: For load instructions like `LW`, `LD`.
     - **Store Buffer**: For store instructions like `SW`, `SD`.

3. **Availability Check**:
   - The function checks if there is an available slot in the corresponding reservation station or buffer:
     - If an available slot exists:
       - The fields of the station or buffer are updated based on the instruction entry.
     - If no slot is available:
       - The instruction is not issued in the current cycle.

4. **Instruction Table Update**:
   - When an instruction is successfully issued:
     - The `instructionTable` is updated with the instruction details.
     - The `pc` is incremented to point to the next instruction in the queue.

5. **No Issue Scenario**:
   - If no available slots are found for the instruction:
     - The function exits without making any changes, and the instruction remains in the queue.

---

## **Execute Function**

### **Regarding the Reservation Stations**

The execution logic for reservation stations involves checking each station to determine if it is ready for execution based on its dependencies and state:

1. **Initial Check**:
   - Each reservation station is checked to see if it is `busy` and both `Qj` and `Qk` are `0`. This indicates that the reservation station has no dependencies and is ready for execution.

2. **Current Cycle Check**:
   - If the instruction is issued in the current cycle, no operation is performed, and the function returns.

3. **Latency Initialization**:
   - If `timeRemaining` is `undefined`, it is initialized with the latency corresponding to the operation (`opcode`).
   - The instruction table is updated:
     - **Execute Start Time**: Set to the current clock cycle.
     - **Execute End Time**: Calculated as `current clock cycle + latency - 1`.

4. **Execution Process**:
   - If `timeRemaining === 1`:
     - The instruction is executed, performing the ALU operation, and the result is stored in the `result` field of the reservation station.
   - If `timeRemaining > 1`:
     - `timeRemaining` is decremented by 1.

### **Additional Checks for Integer Reservation Stations**
- For integer reservation stations, if the `opcode` is `BEQ` or `BNE`:
  - The branch condition is calculated, and the result is checked against zero.
  - Depending on the result, the `pc` (program counter) is updated accordingly.

---

### **Regarding Loads and Stores**

1. **Initial Check**:
   - Each buffer (load or store) is checked to see if it is `busy` and `Q` is `0`. This indicates that the buffer has no dependencies and is ready for execution.

2. **Latency Initialization**:
   - If `timeRemaining` is `undefined`, it is initialized with the latency of the instruction.

3. **Execution Process**:
   - If `timeRemaining === 1`:
     - For **load instructions**:
       - The value is fetched from the cache. 
       - **Cache Miss**: If the value is not in the cache, `timeRemaining` is increased to 2.
       - **Cache Hit**: If the value is in the cache, it is read, stored in the buffer's `result` field, and `timeRemaining` is set to 0.
     - For **store instructions**:
       - The value is written to the cache.

---
## **Write Back Function**

1. **Identify Completed Instructions**:
   - Loop through all reservation stations and check for the following conditions:
     - The `result` field is not empty, indicating the instruction has completed execution.
     - The reservation station is marked as `busy`.
     - `timeRemaining` is `0`, meaning the instruction has finished execution.
     - The current clock cycle is greater than the cycle when execution finished.
   - Instructions meeting these criteria are added to an array of "finished instructions."

2. **Handling Multiple Completed Instructions**:
   - If more than one instruction is ready to be written back, the following fallback mechanism is applied:

   - **Dependency Count**:
     - Loop through all reservation stations and buffers.
     - Check if `Qj` or `Qk` matches the tag of a finished instruction (e.g., `M1`, `A1`).
     - Increment the dependency count for each instruction based on these matches.

   - **Select Instruction to Write Back**:
     - The instruction with the **maximum number of dependencies** is prioritized for write-back.
     - **Tiebreaker**: If multiple instructions have the same number of dependencies, the instruction with the **earliest issue time** is selected.

3. **Broadcast Results**:
   - The selected instruction is pushed to the CDB.
   
   - Its result is broadcasted to:
     - Reservation stations (`Qj`, `Qk` fields).
     - Buffers (`Q` fields).
     - Register files (`Q` field).
    - The instruction it self is removed form the station by setting busy to `false` and deleting the timeRemaining
